# PV-Series-Associaion-Simulator-underPSC-MATLAB
This repository contains MATLAB code for simulating the electrical characteristics of photovoltaic (PV) panels connected in a series configuration under partially shaded conditions (PSC). The model is mathematically modeled based on the single-diode equivalent circuit of a PV cell and incorporates ideal bypass diodes, allowing for reproduction of the resulting current-voltage (I-V) and power-voltage (P-V) curves.
# Key Features
Implements the single-diode mathematical model of PV cells
Models partial shading effects across series-connected PV modules
Simulates the influence of bypass diodes (assumed ideal)
Generates I-V and P-V characteristics with multiple (MPPs)
# Applications
This simulator can be used for:
Educational demonstrations of partial shading effects 
Benchmarking PV modeling accuracy under non-uniform irradiance
